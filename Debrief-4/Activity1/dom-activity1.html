    <p id="'paragraph2">Introducing the world's easiest party starter. Baked Brie! This is how how you transform a good
        value brie into
        a spectacular brie. It's like the best cheese dip you will ever have!! An excellent option for a shared entree
        or party food that's super quick and easy to prepare that has wow factor.

        Serve with crostini or crackers (try these homemade fruit & nut crackers!).</p>

    <p>Baked Brie is, quite simply, the best melted cheese in the world. When you cut through the rind and the
        inside
        comes pouring out like lava, you'll forget all your troubles. It's like cheese-aholic heaven!

        But cheese addiction aside, here's the practical reason why Baked Brie needs to be on your radar:

        It's the world's easiest appetiser / party starter!

        Just pop a brie in the oven for 15 minutes, or microwave it for 2 minutes. Plonk on a platter, add a mound of
        crispy crackers and watch the hands dive in to do THIS:</p>
